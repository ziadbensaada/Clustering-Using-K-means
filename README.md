# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This TP (Travaux Pratiques) demonstrates the implementation of customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this TP, we use K-Means clustering to group customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this TP contains information about customers, including their ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named donnees_clients.csv.

## Steps to Follow
1. Data Preprocessing:
  Handle missing values.
  Remove duplicate entries.
  Perform outlier detection if necessary.
  Normalize the data.
2. Implement K-Means Clustering:
  Determine the optimal number of clusters.
  Apply K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
3. Visualize Clusters:
  Visualize the clusters to understand the distribution of customers across segments.
4. Interpret Results:
  Interpret the characteristics and behaviors of each customer segment.
  Identify actionable insights for business strategies.
5. Conclusion:
  Summarize the findings and the implications for business decisions.
## Technologies Used

Python
pandas
scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Files
donnees_clients.csv: Input dataset containing customer information.
customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.
cleaned_donne_clients.csv: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the TP.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open and run the customer_segmentation.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering offers valuable insights into understanding customer behavior and preferences. By implementing K-Means clustering on the provided dataset, we aim to identify distinct customer segments and derive actionable insights for business strategies.
